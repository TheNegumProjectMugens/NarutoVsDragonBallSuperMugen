Install Notes
------------------------------
-Place contents of zip file inside your screenpack folder, either overwrite everytning or back it up beforehand.
-Make sure your screenpack's system.def points towards the fight.def, this is important.
-Please make sure your RenderMode is set to OpenGL

==What is this?
This is a lifebar for MUGEN 1.1, heavily inspired by Street Fighter V.
==Why did you make this?
This lifebar is part of a Street Fighter game I'm making for myself, I may release the screenpack for it but don't hold your breath.
==How did you make this?
I generally mock things up in photoshop before translating it over to MUGEN. I've used the default MUGEN fight.def as a base, then transplanted things off my mockup straight into the sff using Fighter Factory 3.
==Why MUGEN 1.1?
Even though MUGEN 1.1 is only in Beta, the inclusion of 32-bit png support really caught my eye. I can't understand color restricted formats, so the option to completely ignore them is great. This is probably why I'll never bother making a character.
==This Readme is nostalgic
I can't believe I've been at this for 2 years already.
==The sound in these lifebars is nostalgic as well
Yeah well your face.

==How do I make custom portraits?
Make sure to download SVDRE Ports and PSDs.zip, it contains 3 sets of 23 portraits for Street Fighter characters 

==Can I use code/graphics?
Go ahead. There's nothing really groundbreaking in these files. Let me know if you intend to distribute anything, just so I can check it out. Just add a credit in the top of whatever file you added the code to in comments, or just put it in the system.def.
==Can I make a video of your work?
Please go ahead. Here's a link to my youtube page if you want to link to it: https://www.youtube.com/c/devonmugen
Here's a page to my MugenGuild profile if you want to link to that:

==Are you willing to collaborate?
Sure, shoot me an email or send me a message on Mugenguild.
==Is this readme...
...a copypaste, yeah. Deal with it.

Nothing. This is completer than ever.
